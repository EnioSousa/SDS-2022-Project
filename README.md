# Public Ledger for Auctions

This assignment requires the implementation of a public blockchain (non-permissioned),
but opposite to Bitcoin and Etherium, the purpose here is to have a decentralized public ledger
capable of storing auction transactions.

# Objectives 

- The secure ledger should be modular, and it must support PoW as the core consensus
- A P2P layer to gossip the necessary data to support the blockchain that has to include: Kademlia, Resistance to Sybil and Eclipse attacks
- An auction system capable of supporting sellers and buyers using a single attribute auction following the English auction
